/// <summary>
/// Optional side-quest progression driver. Side quests are NOT part of the main
/// story flow — they run in parallel with StoryManager and never block chapter
/// advancement. They are gated by chapter: a side quest only becomes available
/// once the player has reached its chapter (via ChapterBoundary) AND the main
/// story for that chapter has been completed (so side quests act as post-story
/// exploration content per chapter).
///
/// Design goals:
/// - Reuse the existing QuestData assets (so QuestTrigger/KillCountObjective/
///   CollectibleQuestObjective work unchanged — they all call
///   StoryManager.CompleteActiveQuest, which we DON'T want for side quests).
/// - Stay decoupled from StoryManager's linear flow: completing a side quest
///   must not advance the main story.
/// - Show side quests in the QuestTrackerUI alongside (or instead of) the main
///   quest when the main story for that chapter is done.
///
/// Implementation:
/// - Each side quest has its own QuestData (with questId >= 100 to distinguish
///   from main quests 1-13).
/// - SideQuestManager tracks which side quests are active/completed per chapter.
/// - Side-quest QuestTrigger components call SideQuestManager.CompleteSideQuest
///   instead of StoryManager.CompleteActiveQuest. We do this by giving side-quest
///   triggers a SideQuestTrigger wrapper that routes completion here.
/// - Rewards (EXP + journal) are granted directly, mirroring StoryManager.GrantRewards.
