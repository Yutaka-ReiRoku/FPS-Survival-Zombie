/// <summary>
/// Companion component for side-quest QuestTriggers. Attach alongside a
/// QuestTrigger (or QuestInteractable) that is meant to complete a SIDE quest
/// instead of the main story quest.
///
/// Why this exists:
/// The existing QuestTrigger/KillCountObjective/CollectibleQuestObjective all
/// call StoryManager.CompleteActiveQuest() on completion. For side quests we
/// must NOT advance the main story — instead we call
/// SideQuestManager.CompleteSideQuest(). Rather than fork all those components,
/// SideQuestTrigger intercepts completion: it sets the QuestTrigger's targetQuest
/// to the side quest (so the trigger only fires when the side quest is the
/// "active" one) and, when the trigger fires, routes completion to
/// SideQuestManager instead of StoryManager.
///
/// Usage:
/// - Add a QuestTrigger (Mode=OnPlayerEnter or Manual) + SideQuestTrigger to the
///   side-quest objective location.
/// - Set sideQuest to the side-quest QuestData asset.
/// - The QuestTrigger's targetQuest will be auto-set to sideQuest on Awake so
///   the trigger only fires for this side quest.
///
/// For kill-count / collectible side quests, use SideQuestKillObjective or
/// SideQuestCollectibleObjective instead (they mirror KillCountObjective and
/// CollectibleQuestObjective but route completion to SideQuestManager).
